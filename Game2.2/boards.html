        <p>Startup organizations, inventors and innovators rely on Agile approaches to prototype, evaluate and bring creations to market by way of digital fabrication tools. The Digital Maker and Fabrication (DMF) degree prepares graduates to design and build new technology devices by combining design theory, programming, materials, human factors and prototyping with 3D printing and other maker technologies. Students in this degree will practice taking design concepts and then modeling, designing and building these objects using 3D design software and rapid prototyping tools. DMF students will learn to inform their designs based on choosing the best materials for each design element. Students will learn how to program the embedded systems driving their devices, using tools such as C++ and Arduino, in ways that support creating smart and internet-enabled devices. Students will learn fundamental tools found in makerspaces that allow for rapid prototyping. These include 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC fabric cutters and rapid forming tools. Framing their design and engineering prototype knowledge, DMF students are exposed to how rapid development works within Agile and MVP iterative development cycles. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Digital Maker and Fabrication is 50.0404.  </p>
